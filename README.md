10 CODING HABITS TO REMEMBER
<br>
1. ALWAYS use INTERNATIONAL ENGLISH variable names, and ALWAYS comment in INTERNATIONAL ENGLISH
<br>
2. NEVER use native functions for critical operations, actually try avoiding using native functions at all, because of their lack of control, speed and stability.
<br>
3. ALWAYS try to incooporate as much OOP(Object Orientated Programming) as possible into your code.
<br>
4. NEVER use databases if it can be avoived, because they require certain components that are not always installed.
<br>
5. ALWAYS have a design for your project and a step-by-step procedure for your algorithms.
<br>
6. NEVER try to start a project that is alike the one you just failed.
<br>
7. ALWAYS keep your code from failed projects, because even though they are failed, they might still be usefull.
<br>
8. NEVER copy parts of others code you do not understand since they are always to blame when there are errors.
<br>
9. ALWAYS remember how to count binary on your fingers since they might come handy at anytime when dealing with computers.
<br>
10. NEVER try to do something, but ALWAYS do something! Because most projects fails, not because of lack of experience but because of lack of moral.
